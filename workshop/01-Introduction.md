# Why Python?

Python is popular for several reasons:
- Easy to learn means fast development times.
- Many powerful libraries built for data analysis (e.g., numpy, pandas).
- Great development tools (e.g., virtual environments, unit testing).
- Able to call programs written in lower-level languages (C++, Rust).

Obvious choice for developing libraries for scientific computing.

# Python for scientific computing

Two main "flavors".

*"Quick and dirty".*
- Data analysis with numpy and pandas.
- Usually done in Jupyter Notebook.
    
*"Serious development".*
- Developing libraries to be called from other scripts.
- Usually done with an IDE (e.g., VSCode).
- Version control (Git), writing unit tests, documenting code.

**This workshop focuses on the second group.**

# What we will cover

- Python "best practices".
- IDEs: VSCode.
- Code quality: type hinting, linting.
- Version control: Git.
- Unit testing: Pytest.
- Binding to lower-level code: pybind11.

# How this workshop will work

Combination of:
- Slides with info (like this one).
- Projects to practice what we learned.
